        <p>
        HHello World! I am Aldwin Bernard V. Loreto, currently a third-year Computer Science major in Game Development at Nueva Vizcaya State University. I have a passion for programming and 3D modeling, especially when it comes to creating game assets and implementing game logic.

        During my first year in Computer Science, I learned the fundamentals of coding using C#, which was the primary language for our coursework. I even took commissions from classmates, helping them with programming tasks, which strengthened my problem-solving skills and collaboration.
        
        In my second year, I expanded my skills to web development and data visualization, learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I also explored 2D and 3D plotting using Matplotlib and Pyplot, which enhanced my understanding of modeling and graphics.
        
        Now, in my third year, I have started developing a 3D game with a friend using Unity, while also exploring game development in Godot. Programming and game development are more than just a hobby for me, they are a way to bring ideas to life, solve challenging problems, and create immersive experiences for players.
